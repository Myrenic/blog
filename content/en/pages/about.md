Hi, I’m **Mike Tuntelder**, an IT professional with a passion for automation, infrastructure, and continuous learning.  
This blog is my personal knowledge base, a place to document insights, technical experiments, and lessons learned along the way.

Outside of work, I enjoy exploring new hobbies, improving my home setup, and finding smarter ways to make everyday life a bit more efficient.  
If something here helps or inspires you, that’s a welcome bonus - but primarily, this space helps me remember what I’ve learned.
